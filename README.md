### There are the codes and relevant data associated with the paper:
*Mapping the Molecular Tree of Life using Assembly Spaces*, by Yu Liu, Cole Mathis, Micha≈Ç Dariusz Bajczyk, Stuart Marshall, Liam Wilbraham, Leroy Cronin

------

This repository includes:
1. The Monte Carlo algorithm to calculate the shortest assembly pathways for a single molecule: the excutable file (in AssemblyMC.zip) and the C++ source codes (in AssemblyMC_cpp_sc.zip);
2. The Monte Carlo algorithm to calculate the assembly tree for a group of molecules: the excutable file (in TreeMC.zip) and the C++ source codes (in TreeMC_cpp_sc.zip);
3. The python scripts (and the relevant data) of the *Reassembler* approach that we used to generate the opiate-like compunds in the paper (in GenMols.zip).


* To execute the programs, download the zip files and follow the instructures in the paper.

* To compile the source code by yourself, use Visual Studio 2019 or above. Double click .sln and compile.
